# Block 27 React Forms Workshop
Write controlled React forms that will hit an external API. The API we are using is a small internal FSA API with only two routes, /signup and /authenticate (refer to linked API documentation).

## Requirements
In this workshop, you will pass the /signup route, either a username and password which will come from a React form. On success, the API will send back a token, which you can store, then pass to the server to authenticate future requests. If you are completing this workshop with a partner or team, make sure you switch between the driver and navigator roles!

There are four tabs below:\
Initialize the Project with npm\
Sign Up Component to send and receive username and password to the API\
Authenticate Component, token and authentication\
Wrapping Up\

### React, vite, babel, ESlint rules
